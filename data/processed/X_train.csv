i do not have word to appreciate this  so just thank u verrrry very very very much founder of its
the fail boat has arrived the 60 version is touted as being advanced but in fact it contains a big old disappointment the widget which wasnt even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts is now no longer available wth  fail why do i want to use an sms app or any messaging app which cant even give me a quick review widget on my home screen  pffft  rolled back to 42 apk and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets one  personspecific

way below expection why does it lag so much scroll garda ni freeze hunxa get it right kntipur i expected so much
fast on slow phones this seems to be the fastest browser ive been able to find for slow phones its works great on my ancient samsung and nothing usually works great on this old phone lol
app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android usually great app but stops working a random timesvery annoying  have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now may need to find another app
aa nice
yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choicevery important some of the people making choices for us are not well the i thought tony bennetthe good lifeto be sussinct
its suck any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network realy very suck
fix some things one letter is capitalized and it goes back again to lowercaseemoji donot appear when i send them box appears but not emotions and include more emoji
too many recent glitches i used to play this all the time im level 500 but now cant even log into the game it started removing received boosters n not recording passed levels so theyd have to b replayed now it tries to load for 58 mins then just kicks me off havent been able to play for weeks now will b uninstalling soon if not fixed really disappointed with candy crush now
ever so useful evernote it is so easy to scribble something down when you have your smart phone tablet laptop or whatever  you can be spontaneous yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time  when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you  almost magical  such a time saver and a memory keeper
often painfully slow needs a useful tablet ui quick reply and the ability to send video some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that isnt really excusable from the company that runs android this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets
video capture for moment where did video moment go i want to capture video but i cant find it where to capture video when i slide downwards nothing came out is it bcuz the new updatesthere is no video for new updates fix this problem pleasee
no google sync uninstall until it can sync with google calendar i hate having to use separate apps for these things
this game i donno y ppl give it 1 star try it out n i think if two updates  come wit heros it must be a titan n a character  from naruto  madara uchiha
on sghi727 android 412 the new platform showing all contacts reduced your rating not just like the online status that doesnt give us option to identify our contacts that are online without having to tap on contacts one by one to see there  individual online status and without necessarily having your disableenable our personal settings useless option that doesnt work frustrated users ratings going lower and lowerloosing your edge specialy with no response from you other than the automated generic in privaye email
galaxy note 4 note 101 tab  tab 3 70 its getting better much better but keep working on it especially the talk texting also what did you to google voice please please please fix wth can only text  receive text from google voice really  i can facetime from contacts w4g lte  new update 511 please dont mess it up with marshmallows 60 if its not broke please stop trying to fix it google youre making me want to come out of retirement and come work for you guys
not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just wont respond it doesnt seem to be fixated on a certain website or so it happens at random it is far much better than before and yes its not my phones fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone no problem there
low quality i dont know why but sound is very bad especially when i talk i use meizu m2 mini and is not slow phone at all is there some update or setup whitch can fix it i will rate 5 stars if theres a fix
wont load everytime i try to use facebook well lately it says trouble loading in every aspect its been doing this for 2 days ive tried restarting my phone closing the app it doesnt work
neat idea but letdown by no linux support an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service which is where evernote fails  it is not natively available for linuxbased operating systems such as ubuntu sure the android application works well enough  but when the only way to access evernote under a linuxbased operating system is via a web browser it quickly looses its appeal
too much going on its cool it works but ony using it because i have to its got way to much going on for a note pad adds in useless irrelevant information like i made a note on a friends birthday now it says from so and sos birthday but it works great just wish it was just a plain jane note pad like the one htc used this app to replace if there was a way to over complicate a note pad app they did itit works great like i said and it takes some getting used to and it grows on you
load shedding widget not syncing the load shedding widget does not sync otherwise the app is awesome for me
new message notification fault it doesnt notify you of new messages real time you can only identify new messages if you open the app therefore you can not respond to messages real time
the worst this newer versionupdate might look nice but i stopped getting all push notifications also the app doesnt even work most of the time nothing loads and it keeps telling me to try again it worked fine before until the most recent update same as other apps it just gets worse and worse dont fix it if its not broke
camera option is horrible you cant crop the image sideways it has to be perfect square or rectangle  camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images and it needs notebooks within notebooks the camera flash always on and when you do needs it it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch
two stars it used to work really well and the colors and nicknames and emojis are really cool and the snow and the hearts when sending some emojis are really cool but the last update really ss cant use any other app when using the chat heads youtube stops when using the chat heads the message sending is slow sometimes it doesnt even feel that im connected to the internet and sometimes cant even send the messages please fix it as soon as possible
always fun but i like this new frozen shadows but the depth perception is not so good its hard to see an approaching corner other then that small bug i love this game and will continue to play it
absurdly large file for an android browser and after lollipop upgrade i no longer have the space available for updates would gladly uninstall if i could over 40 megs for an android browser
major flaws constant updates and always getting not installed messages  i can use it for awhile and then its no longer installed  none of my other apps do this
all these updates all these updates but still no improvement on high ram usage it drained battery so much and my phone is very hot when using this messenger only now there is even a sync issues too it wont sync when it supposed to
works fine for the most part not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices im usually logged in 247 on 2 computers and a phone
what the hell stole all my boosters all my boosters and power ups are gone return it now had more than 60 of each what a cheap manner to manage the game return all power ups nowww
constantly erases text i have frequently lost messages ive been typing sometimes very long ones when the screen changes orientation if i tip my screen even a little and messenger shift the orientation it instantly erases everything ive written
great perfect no complaints
cant switch back you have to go to phone setting to switch to another keyboard you should add choose input method on keyboard if im missing it teach me how to find that
more than notes just use it for notes but it is a powerful app like the checklist but we use a shopping list program for that and sync with my wifes htc m8 may want to try sharing with this app soon though
it was good untill i upgrade overall opera mini is good the page loads faster and saves time but most of the time eventhough i have a good network connection it will show that there is no network connection then  when i upgrade to this version  the network speed after this update is really so fastwhen i tried to download a song  eventhough i have 3g connection it downloads at a rate of 47 kbsec  it took 20 mins to download a 6mb song in a 3g connection i am really frustrated with this so i am going to uninstall it
khtra xa estae aap hagu banae rakhnu parxa hau mitra haru loved it
2 big issues 1  there is no download manager in chrome  when i select save target as  i dont have any control over the download  i cant pause or cancel it after that and most of the times i am unable to download the file         2  i cant use two chrome tabs in multi window on note 3  i can do that in note 5 but it just doesnt work in note 3  plz fix
chat why you would make it so it changes the chat colour and name  for both people i have no idea update it so changes only the person doing it and will be 5
once a great game i was a hardcore fan of this game but u gotta admit the latest update sucks its impossible for farming if u wanna make some loot u gonna have to go gowipe or something it takes a minimum of 1 hourwithout boost to make troops and that sucks plz fix this asap before i with many others move on
very smooth id say its much better than just uc browser which loads pages as if you are on your laptop with a really bad server love everything about it 
its nice  accecesible where mobile mobie data is or wifi if accesible so that if are are in in trouble of any soranyttime we can immediatetely tweet which reaches to near n dear ones  other thousands of ther too on the web helpful in many ways 
bad new update sight by swipe in chats gone please put back the option where users could quickly record a sight just swiping down on the chats screen its horrible to try to record a sight now having to go through so many screens by the time its open now the moment is gone ive missed many moments i would have recorded before why change something that works well and not broken
profile any time my wife or anybody has more than one post and i view them it would take me to there profile so that i can view them all at once now when i try to view them it tells me that the page that i requested is not available ive restarted my phone i even cleard the cache and ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is still doing it please fix it thank you
very user friendly for those looking for a straight forward note taking app that syncs across devices and has user friendly features look no further evernote simplified my electronic note taking with charm
too much pop up add
freaking awesome it has no real story line but it doesnt matterthis was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love itits almost better than super mario brother for crying out loudthe characters are greatthe pigs are cuteand it has my favorite bird in it hall or green birdnot gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea also the pigs forts are awesome so thats why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year
it is best app for regular news update but please add more news updates in nepali language too
need some improvements hey guys i personally love this app as it is too easy to type in nepali as it automatically unicodes but you need to add some more features this app doesnt include capslock theme customizationit is really hard to type in big screen tabletsphones coz its size relatively small so please in next update include the features mentoined above then it will worth      thanks
umm while this game has gotten kinda old and ive basically replaced it with the soda saga game i still like playing this but for some reason for i dont know how many days now every time i go to open this game itll load a little and then crash closed fix please
cool really great and awesome graphics offline is great for going to a nowifi place love it

nice browser but there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile great options to customize the browser to suit your needs however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites i hope the speed improves in newer versions and ill add a 5 star rating
best keyboard it is the best ever nepali keyboard lightweight and does what it says but can you please make it look stylish like google keyboard or others it looks preety old in design so please redesign its layout
its brilliant take a photo on my phone and within a minute its on my pc at home file same make a change on a file on my phone and its changed on the file at home  this app makes the above so easy no issues crashes or problems  just great
account in private it just keep on saying that my account is in private  and needs to verify  but when i do  it keeps on asking my cp number  when i already filled the gven information  it keeps mentioning about security  i just dont know how to deal with it  can you tell me how 
awsome but i  this game but i dont like the frozen bit my sister has had eye site and she can see the normal one and she cant  see the frozen ones so she keeps dieing luckerly we can change back to the normal one but the frozen one takes longer to load so when the frozen whone is out the window i will rate 5 stars but the rest is awesome
profile issues samsung galaxy s4 active so every time i post a pic on fb it says not available and i cant even edit it it shows some gray part on top plzz fix it i would of rated a 5 but since this happened i rated 2

man i hate google and android went into my messaging and the default had changed to hangouts instead of sms stop forcing settings to change when you push through updates man im moving to apple as soon as i am able i hate this phone and your system
agree with new ui being too much like fb also there is literally no way to modify the app settings the only option given is to view your linkedin apps why was this removed major necessity when youre getting spammed everytime someone posts an update
keep calm and play temple run its really fun the graphic is great and youll never feel boring with that game
the best android browser fast well designed easy tab management i was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and its done great 
doesnt allow me to send tab to desktop previously when i touched the share button it allowed me to select firefox as the share method to send the tab to my synched computer now the share to firefox option doesnt show up why did it dissapear
complete bull was on 1186 and went to play and had lost all my boosters had over 100 different boosters saved up some i payed for never again
good good for slow connection this uc minilite version does not take much spacememory in ram it is faster also than uc
simply good but i think loss of reply option keeps people away from this app because especially in the groups its necessary to show whom your chatting with
very good application ever dharai ramro app ho yo but kalo background malai aalikati man paren plz hamrokeyboard team lai yo bharema ali sochnuna maile anurodh garchu
not happy with this app not one of my life or ticket requests come through i get notified on fb that people have sent themthen when i open the app there is nothing therehaving to pay to get to the next level really sux

poor customer service the heart button crashes the app whenever i hit it hasnt been fixed ever since its introduction within weeks my rate dropped to 1 star unfortunately
better user interface worse quality the user interface is definitely better now but at the same time there is a bug concerning synchronising the contacts with the phone contacts and even when that bug got fixed the contact photo doesnt get shown any more in contrary to previous releases

favorite menu update is suboptimal the new update puts the entire list of favorites into view from most recent instead of returning me to my previous folder which it always has this requires more time and clicking to get to the desired folder please give an option to return it to the previous version
wtf it worked for the last 3yrs then all of a sudden almost all my msgs dont send and neither does my friends i tried meeting up with someone recently and we couldnt get each others msgs and missed out i use to use it with one friend constantly and now it barely works what the hell
app requires frequent login password why the hell this app everytime requires password to openthis is not expected from proffesional app like thiswho the hell remembers password for each and every app or site
it was working great  before the bugs  worse  with the bugd and without
so much room for improvement the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still hasnt lived up to its full potential heres an example how dont we have the capability to save gifs and videos not only that but itd be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances simple updates like those would make this app so much better not lame ones like changing favorites to likes hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016
wechat 63 with wechat out is no longer free hate it for wechat out now as its no longer free which playback sound of video is muted after finishing call with wechat out why charge when its not up to mark yet

developers please read i think there needs to be some kind of confirmation implemented when the buy extra moves for 9 gold bars button is clicked i recently didnt do so well on a level and i ran out of moves when going to press end game  i  pressed the extra moves by accident and it took 9 bars even though i had no intention of continuing i felt hurt after saving them up for so long please consider this
privacy you must provide system in which no one should be able to download profile image moreover if there will be video calling option then 5 rating is must kindly do the needfull
when you repeat over and over that you support animated gifs now maybe a good idea would be to actually support them
not supported your new updated temple run 2 frozen shadows map is not supported to my device which is the samsung galaxy v ill give 5 stars if you will make this updated map support my device plss i need to play that map ive been waiting this for a couple of months
multitab button on topright side is missing  so u cant switch between multiple tabs easily bcoz the small box on the topright corner that tells u how many tabs r open isnt there any more also when u play video in a website the audio and video wont be moving at the same speed meaning the video frams will move ridiculously slow while audio plays at regular speed i guess thats the problem with the flash player overall poor web experience with this browser

sometimes if i turn off wifi both messenger and fb apps stop responding and if i dont kill the app and leave it be for a while it would jam the phone looking for the cause
too many useless features does anybody actually use the speed dial cards why cant i get rid of the discovery button on speed dial also the my videos setting is pointless because i have a video player sometimes less is more
brilliant app brilliant app for browsing and for fbdownloading is fastest compared to other browsersone thing it has to improve is that it should be made safer for browsing nd some web pages does not open in this browser
totally diferent from the web page do not use this app use the web page instead you will be able to do much more from there it is almost impossible to apply to a job from here
i love this app it is better than tv and old radio
some notification problem although ive enabled notification  i am not being able to get notification only from ekantipur on my htc desire 826 and it is slower than in other inferior devices i want to know if this problem is only with me or ekantipur is working on this kind of devicenotification feature is very useful for a busy person like me who doesnt get much time to sit back and read news notifications enables to take a quick look at headlines and understand the situation and can read the selected news according to choice

google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android if it detects they are using hangoutsgoogle messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts which will show up in the conjoined app but if it doesnt detect them using hangoutsgoogle messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead

absolutely the best for saving documents forms notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you dont have to worry about where you saved it  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for  its that easy
better background playback and new tab position firefox is the bestlooking browser on android if i do say so myself what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background since i use youtube as ambience a lot and the new tab button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier

not since the update i dont                                  update it is very slow on both data uk ee network and wifi all of home via bt work networklondon underground virgin network on all devices version number is 130203698649 on each device  practically unusable at present and everything was fine before upgrading  reading other comments im far from the only one having problems high and low quality images helps but it is still worse than before the upgrade  and just discovered that previously a double tap enlarged the text sufficiently to make it readable  now it enlarges it a tiny amount but pinch and zoom is still required    why did you do this  the good old adage if it aint broke dont fix it absolutely comes to mind
chrome since last update you cant scroll down or up  the entire page blinks  blinks hurts my eyes ug it is slower  freezes  too big   to download mp3 of many sites i have to use another browser  they will not download  mrsgwennd
the old one is better the previous version kept track of group conversations better  now i cannot see new activity within groups i follow
amazing game awesome game so entertaining and very fun this app is my favorite game i hope evrybody puts a 5 star for rating because this app is cool
want to know why did the other people i can see only 10 post and i cant like or comment their post  is that mean their unfriend me or something wrong with that 
this is it so this is gonna be the list of things you need to improve for constant five stars  include more emojis  the ones you provided dont even express enough feelings of a dog   provide instructions somewhere because people have uninstalled this app because they were more confused than they were thankful to you guys  when i capitalize english letterd only one letter is capitalized and it goes back to lowercase fix this  you guys are awesome i love this app  no more bugs keep up the great work 
temple run 2 frozen shadows i love this game so much i love being in the ice but only one thing that i hate about it is that the monster goes infront of u when your running but as you go further into the game it gets harder but able to pass the monster
why change it i use this for my facebook as its a lot faster than any other app but now when i try to add a pic the whole format on opera mini has changed i cant even see the pic i want to choose now and have to go through so many folders as well go back to the old format why fix something that wasnt broken
best nepali typing apps 1you can type any nepali text in eng and it will show suggestion of nepali words 2you can copy it in sd card and transfer to your pc alsoand many moreyou will only know after installing it 
it was a great game  until the last update  and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players  and lets not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish   seems like supercell only cares aboutwants high level trophy pushers  and they dont want people who dontcant buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it
this new update i havent signed into my google account on clash of clans and since the new update i cant log in and cant remove the game and download it again because then i will lose everything please help me get my game to load
hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it however adding some features will definitely make it the best app following are few things observed 1 the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2 few letters were not available along with words 3 also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the underscore 4 easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star
too much pop up add average app with too much advertisement one star for the app and 5 star for the pop up advertisement
great game too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game unless you get adfree be prepared to get ads up the butt
great features but my notifications dont work title says it all the app says i should be getting the notifications on my phone but im not getting any would rate 5 stars if this was resolved
twitter is great to connect with my classmates as im on exchange at the moment however i cannot view whos liked my posts it will say theres 9 likes but will only show me 3 also the notifications arent very good sometimes it wont tell me if someone has followed me or if theyve likedretweeted one of my posts
it sucks i am always shown offline and unable to send a single message  to my team
not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of no benefits either issues begin to arise and multiply exponentially upon applying any changes if using a text size other than the default a substantial lagreloading begins to occur when scrolling zooming in or out causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank also in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras
way to ruin it this game was good at one point  i supported this game with real money  if you cant say anything nice i hope other people can find a good time playing this
excellent my entire team would be lost without this works with web app exceptionally well too
rocking this app is the best among all the news apps
saved pages list should be in alphabetical order as well as in newest to oldest order dear opera mini i hold back one star for not giving us a choice to view the saved pages list in alphabetical order as well as in newest to oldest order please improve on that one thing and i would love to rate five stars to this beautiful browser opera mini
the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly    if youve ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytimeall the time using powerful searches then evernote is for you take a picture of anything and store it scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note forward emails directly into evernote drag and drop computer files create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode clip pages or parts of web pages use voice   
cant open after update the app crashes and doesnt open neither for a second uninstalled and installed many times  no change please let me know how to fix it people write me there and i dont receive nothing

too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian the new one is double the size and takes more space its not even as fast as the earlier one what a shame seems improved after update

buggy after update after the update chrome will freeze chrome isnt responding which gives me an option to wait for it or kill the app this happens every time i reopen the app and some times from recent
excellent reception amazing app that lets you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills
not enough space 6g is nothing these days need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller please dont go to that material crap   not evertone likes the cheap material design it is designed for lazy devs who like the easylazy way
bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet please take a look at it and send a reply or update handset  note 5 hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again
bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years  the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it  so after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print which you can only see after purchasing the tablet dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices  this is sleazy and bait and switch  free not subject to any compensation encumbrance repayment in kind etc  because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services
wonderful apps i have downloaded this apps in my cellphone its very good apps for those who loves nepali language great apps

errors and bugs app of error
widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a notetaker i access it primarily through its widget the old widget was great giving a peek at a few recent notes then that widget was killed off and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes with maybe just part of the title of a third note and no content at all it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason also theres no undo button
new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them  submitting issues doesnt seem to work in the mobile app the submit button is never enabled this last update was a loser

love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life
really great twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day i do have problems with it though this is personal preference whenever i refresh the page it gives me a tweet with the subtext twitter name follows twitter name and it happens every time i refresh so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets othe than that its fine

candy crush i have been  having trouble playing on candy crush so in the end i uninstalled it  i then reinstalled and signed back in in doing this im back to my level but lost all my boosters
i wish there is a mute button for selected people i like it so far but it is more like a skype now but i hope next update the will be option like mute button where i can mute someone so that i wont recieve any notification from that particular person without deleting the message or blocking them coz that would be so rude if i do that or option where i can hide the seen or a mark as unread other than that it is good i liked it thats all my concern
the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed eg  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile
2many adds great game ruined by too many adds way too many adds now not even fun anymore was great now its terrible
the ads ruin my fav app i mean the ads for viber desktop i dial my friend start talking and what happens next is my microphone turns off speakers turn on and the browser starts launching so my friend is saying something for everyone to hear because she cant hear me and i am pushing buttons like crazy trying to stop browser from launching it does take a while on my phone what happens every time is that viber desktop ad launches about 3s after i make a call thats the right way to stop me using the smartphone app
connection issues app always says cant refresh now try later which in particular has to do with the net but my wifi works well enough i can even play online games i can refresh my feed at ig and twitter so why cant i refresh my fb feed fix it please

nice game its simply amazingbut i would like it better if we had custom options for graphics it runs extremely smooth but the developer should go easy on the memory that is it takes more space now than ever before but overall its an epic game
dud on droid4 doesnt work on my new droid4

makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed  i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts  plus you can save screenshots websites pictures  anything  and they are searchable
account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying cant create an account at this time
viber i think so shes going to you guys you know figure out free for the rings sometimes i forget to ring in all forget to the shop the message of this one now ill let you know no i hope you figure out later so thats my paper right

nice update really nice update this update is awesome but the quick search is really usless but its okay keep up the good works 
refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months for those of you complaining about crashes that is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly
app continuously losses connection at times i have to close app and reopen for it to reconnect every message also takes around 10 seconds to send
a lil more features to be included there should be a option so as to u the profile pic is not visible to everyone because if you block people then they cant even send you msges and also more no of people in a group maximum should be 500
call disconects in every 5 seconds thats two beep sound is now one of my most hated sound from viber cant u guys fix it before i uninstall the app and use other app
fix or i quit dont download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers the game wont load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play fix these issues or im done but from what i see in the other comments i dont think the developers even care
update does not address facebook issue sadly you all seem not to care that your game is now limited by mandatory facebook connection that doesnt work deleting now
annoying in app purchases a great product but constant popups encouraging you to upgrade ruin the experience
excellent this app is great keep up the good work guys 
the new features suck for those of us who dont have a working back button can you guys make the videos able to be slid to the left to exit the video as i have to force close facebook to exit
some issues i love this app but i have been having some issues lately it has started telling me that hangouts is no longer supported by google play you can not send a video and when on a video chat it seems to lag really bad wish we had something like imessage in our regular text and facetime
my husband and i cant send msgs to each other its saying on both ends that one other aint receiving msgs at this time one messenger we cant recover to see if msgs got blocked  help fix this

almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management thats all i need i tried firefox which i use on desktop as a way of getting away from chrome because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it seriously i hate google unfortunately chrome is still hands down the best browser ive used on android firefox started out fine but became slower and glitchier as i used it like everything except chrome meh
bad bad google why was i sent to password recovery options when updating a browser app  5 stars  is it time to go to an apple or windows phone platform america
garbage no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason still no pdf support finally stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram overflow menu is a cluttered mess
fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot a lot a lot of years older than that just one thing its really really hard but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers even though it can ba a little frustrating
hasnt loaded in almost 16 days have played everyday for 2 years and now it wont let me play at all im sure all my saved up loot and hundreds of trophies have been lost during this time
sucks the new update especially the multiplayer game bonuses sucks please return to before system only this time im getting more loots but supercell stop it saying im playing too long without shield then u got my village under attack and loose many of my loots ur crazy

very reliable syncing butthe web ui looks like its been designed by a college kid with a laptopno grid view2gb free space in 2016wah photos look ridiculous on  list viewthe android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable featuretoo plain and oversimplified uino download option directly to sd card
great app  good tool for my arsenal its like a virtual notebook or binder or file cabinet for me and its wonderful  i use different apps for quick notes and tasks i would use it for tasks if it had repeating reminders  ability to snooze them then also sync wgoogle calendar but if i need to save longterm notes or receipts or travel plans prayers  spiritual writings howtos etc evernote is the app for that  easy to use never loses my notes it is dependable and reliable  i love using the desktop version also
awesome
good thank you for your previous reply but i think you guys got me wrong my friends are not able to endorse my skills and not the opposite i dont know how to enable the endorsement
this update sucks i cant open the game anymore just crashed damn it i have an on going war but the app wont run if there is a half star option to rate this i would give you that fix this asap
whats app is not in its format in my mobile massages are sending through left side and all the layout of whats app is starting from left while in my old mobile all is in right side i feel so much trouble due to this
it is fine and getting better working quite well for me at the minute i liked the recent layout changes and messaging facilities websites links are handled better and able to open in browser as well the problem with notifications still exists  i cant tell if someone accepted my connection request or send me an invitation notifications appear for a second and go away
still not cool guys please this is still not cool after all those updates ive got a lot of ram but it keeps reloading pages that ive left open for later viewing the old one could do that it could keep pages for weeks guys seriously opera please
force close its been 1 or 2 months and yall still havent fix the error i cant play its always crash and force to close everytime im online for 10 seconds
really cool and organized the new update is really amazing the widgets are cool however it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support like hebrew cause when i want to add check box the text removed to the left also you need to add an option to change the size of the preview dont like its so small and app animations would be nice something else to your attention i want to by the app but it really really expensive if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it
i love viber viber is an excellent chatting software only one tiny negative comment for you sometimes it takes a delay to reach message even online  stickers are so cool

its getting there i used to be a chromeopera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang firefox memory consumption is far less and its more stable however i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection i use 4g and bandwidth aint a problem i know you can fix it but ill give you 4 stars for now thanks for the awesome browser

this update completely destroyed my facebook it loads to the status screen but once i try click anything at all or scroll the app goes to my home screen it doesnt even say force close it just does it so i load it again and finally begin scrolling but not even 5 scrolls later the app closes this never happened before i updated fb
seriously needs usability updates app is ok but storage jumps from free to 10mo after downloading files dropbox asks to upload it great but it asks for the folder every time from the root directory still there is no intermediate plan for storage it goes from free to 10 mo for 1 tb i dont need 1 tb but i do need something more than the free plan google drive will be my new storage since they offer an intermediate plan i asked for something middle of the road but they arent interested im going to drop dropbox where it belongs in the trash box

great app but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android its fast and efficient and all the addons are great yet the menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes and theres no way to force it

extremely useful app but has a tendency every so often to glitch out and eat half my battery before i realize what its doing also needs to let users define a cap on how much device storage it can hog i recently discovered this app eating nearly a gig of my tablets already scarce internal storage all on its own i now clear its data manually every few weeks to stop this
doesnt work every time i try to sign up it says couldnt processes registration it did the same thing on my android tablet and my doogee x5 cell phone please fix and i will rate 5 stars

viber sarl this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options really nice app and pretty stable running just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself i recommend this app

could be so much better if theyd stop making unneeded changes while i love twitter i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads also there should be a quicker way to access your lists like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome and also ive heard that twitter is testing a nonchronological timeline that is the worst idea ever if that is implemented without a way to turn it off i wont use twitter anymore honestly if third party apps had push notifications i wouldnt use the official app at all oh and moments is dumb

too slow loading webclips no pdf support at all even simpler apps do that  web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded any program does thisgeez  highlighting needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow no customer support responses either evernote must have been taken over by students its not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell  this is especially for serious business users any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes this program has really retarded over the years they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless well they got my money this time so i have to put up with it for a few more months the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this

annoyed whatsapp used to work great but with the recent update messages didnt want to come through unless i went into the app i assumed it was my phone but samsung said everything is working great so i was advised to uninstall and then reinstall whatsapp i did just that it picked up my old number and backed everything up until it got to the initiating please wait a moment page its been 3h now and nothing has changed is there any way to solve this i would really like to get back online
this used to be my favorite app this was the only app that i used for messaging for quite a while that was all the way up until the notifications stopped working this has been a major annoyance and has proved to be extremely problematic as well i love everything about this app apart from the fact that it does not notify me when i get a message since this is a google application youd think that a bug so simple would be gotten rid of but i must say im quite disappointed with the google team
i cant get back on facebook its my email thats wrong or my password no matter what i do it just sucks because i really want to talk to my grandchildren thats the only way i can see or hear from them most of the time

video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine wont load and will play but the screen will show grey fix please i dont know if others have this issue but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this

ive used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years but since this latest update its become unusable on my galaxy note 101  links either dont work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops  bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes cant be accessed  i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing please sort it out mozilla

frequently resets once again it has reset and taken all stored boosters this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other i dont understand why that information isnt stored since things like your level and gold are retained
all nepali must use

contacts and delays is it just me with the new update all contacts are showing up including those who are not using viber the old version allows you to hide your contacts who are not using viber i also that notifications on messages are delayed pls fix this
addictive  the only negative is that youre never given gold bars  you have to buy them

shite crashes constantly test 1st does nothing a browser should obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release      i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing  bonus crashing the operating system
game ruined because of ads i felt like redownloading after havent playing it in awhile but i was immediately frustrated a 20 second awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level and after looking at the store i realized that you have to pay to remove ads yep uninstalling

bookmarks the option to open a bookmark in a new tab is taken away i use that feature and would like it back also now the keyboard opens automatically which i often dont want and have to close it
its useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesnt look as appealing as the mobile app and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions eg the ability to delete tags or to strikethrough text
good app its a good app for people especially student like mebut i just think that it would be better if it become more colourfulmaybe not too colourful but more colourit will be more attractive to student like me to use itthanks for the app btw

down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015 then one of these useless all new redesigns was perpetrated  now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound silent vibrate etc are nowhere to be found  had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet that is unforgivably incompetent  i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout as many other reviewers do   boo  from 4 stars to 1

the best game about they dont call this the no1 app for nothing its the original and best clean game about one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling funny though i thought they had wings it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come its as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s its so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet but thankfully the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline

no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phones contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed
download stops the iteam iam downloading stop half way or about 13 percent or it just does begin at all please fix this and ill rate it 5 stars

excellent app but still needs a bit more work keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate  my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards  also like google keyboard if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button it would be really helpful  then itll get 5 stars good stuff nonetheless

ok for the simple stuff feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging its fine but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips can be a bit slow to load conversations overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner  which is obviously not ideal for every other action especially since it uses google auth services 
dont like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now professional vibe is gone poor facebook knockoff is here to stay its not just the aesthetics but the design as well simple things like viewing my connections or viewers require more time more taps and more effort than before others connections are listed seemingly randomly making it arduous to find anyone its worse on iphone where speed is at a snails pace linkedin has lost its identity and if it continues in this direction it will lose its userbase too
support service poor support service
i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones
new user great app have suggestions so far i love working with the app on all devices desktop web  android phone it integrates very well with other related apps however i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things 1 allow check boxesbullet items to be easily reordered dragdrop its kind of a big deal for me and 2 allow duplication of notes if these functions already exist then hopefully someone will share how to do it or ill figure it out soon enough and then ill gladly rate 5 stars great job guys
