review
useful and well designed however glitchy the app is really well designed however ive begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either persons end the app does not record how long the conversation lasted in fact it doesnt show that a call even took place
dami nepal iz improving there limts  gud y
all in one app dis version of uc browser mini disappointed me as search showing in notification bar and when v download anything was not visble in notification bar as previous version its request to look into it and try to solve it otherwise as i have to uninstall it and goto some other app
fastest browser its fast its reliable the only problem i have with it it dont like to download videos or games so both videos  games it goes to the site just no downloads come up  also the lil emojis that have action to them it dont show their lil action i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser maybe the fastest so please fix those bugs

cannot cast to chromecast of all the apps that chromecast supports chrome browser is not supported why how am i supposed to cast my browser use firefox or worse wait for ie fix it already chrome come on
glitch y i like this browser better than chrome in terms of its setup and function but i wish it was less glitchy the back button seems to just lock up the tab on a certain website  sad face
didnt work couldnt use it with my note 4 it just gets stuck in the red o and stops
hate it the new update shifted my tab in lower keyits just sooo irritatingtab looks good on chrome window onlyi want tht bk
no longer a casual game the current version of the game makes it too hard to play casually anymore expect to spend 46 hours a day just to stay afloat
meh hope it supports dual sim when used as default sms manager and hangouts running very slow when opening a conversation
it used up my battery i forgot to switch back to my home screen and keep opening dropbox app then my battery dropped from 50 to 25 in 30mins it really is a dropbox
great code but arrogant company linkedin should be proper stewards of the database they have created and ensure their customers get optimum use too many gotchas no cut and paste from messages closed apis etc pretty narrow minded
thanks u so much for adding sanshkar fm kalaiya all in one ones app thanks so much dont update its great version
well i just switched to a new htc phone and now chrome forces closed whenever im reading mostly text websites it just happend twice in the span of ten minutes and its getting annoying i dont even have other apps running in the background or too many tabs open so i dont know whats going on with it
we have a problem so ive noticed that twitter will let me like nonspecific things until im blue in the face but liking certain specific things get me booted from the app and i have to log back in let me repeat that like certain specific things gets me logged out and i have to log back in whats going on twitter support
it sucks right now the special  levels are rigged  im sure you cant win just waste your lives and boster f it ready to un install it
makes top left of my screen unresponsive many lg v10 users lose the ability to tap the top left of their screen when this app is installed this issue makes uses other apps impractical and sometimes impossible as this issue holds phones hostage if fixed ill change my review to 5 stars
google messenger unite with hangouts  dialer big problemi have updated to android 601 ever since update contacts in mobile contacts do not since merge or anything  it acts as a regular text messenger  please fix  i need my google voice hangouts  dialer fail to work or merge at all
great game but too many ads almost not worth playing
almost every time i scroll on a webpage the copy dialog appears at the top of the page also i dont care for the new tab openedswitch popup that appears on the screen when i open another tab i think that should be in the opera mini settings menu
sound decrease issue when i play a video in uc player its 100 sound is equal to my device 60 sound why sound is decreased in uc mini and shows full volume
awsome great  type of social media nothing wrong with it it used to crash on my phone but since the update its doesnt even lag a bit pleaz get
preview not available i cannot view my ms office files if this problem still exists will it be more convenient to move all files to one drive
translation use it for browsing and visiting viet and chinese and other country sites for translations but using uc browser for downloading no other app can replace uc for fast downloading speed
whatsapp  free if you want an app that is basically the same and is free forever get line free calls  messaging i personally like line more because you are able to get different stickersimages to send in the chat
all you need easy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals the software itself is great and the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it great job
keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites dont loadplease fix this or i am moving to another browser
good app but why do post come up in a random order on the home screen i have 4 day old posts at the top and have to scroll down to find new posts which are buried between 1 day to 1 week old posts it needs to have an option for what order you want the posts in
showing old news why is it showing that someone responded to my comment a week ago im not getting any crashing but its showing stuff from a week ago on top of my news feed
either make the moving forward process 3 bars or less time to wait you need to change the peramiters to move to the next episodetired of waiting 3 days as you paid people up with other people who no longer play
disappointed first of all id like to thank the creators of the uc browser for this is the best browser that i have ever used now why 3 stars because i was planning to download a game but uc browser cant download it the page loads but no downloads and i have to use mozilla because of this particular reasoni want to give you guys a five star but until you fix this i will just give you 3 starthank you just please help me with  this one i want to use only one browser
brilliant but not complete please add more emojis and if possible themes too u need to compete with others eventually
very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it runs well during roaming and with low signal i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion  just like in twitter etc but within the group not public would be great
cant change my color like every one els my friend updated his when i did mine we have the same phone he got to change colors an mine stayed the same ether fix or im not using this crap app any more
between android or windows10my tablet or my phone i love instant access fantastic simple to use app
does what it says it does but chat heads have limitations the issue i have almost everyday is that when a conversation is open in a chat head you can not paste what is copied to your clipboard everything is works fine enough
contacts sync wont work contacts dont sync anymore app crashes ive tried uninstalling clearing data and cache updating but the issue persist shouldnt had released this version with so many bugs
works great i wish it supported expandable  collapsible hierarchies though
simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time each game is determined by how the candies drop so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare
bad app for a great site linkedin is great but the app sucks i always have problems opening the app most of the times it asks me to retry or try later because the feed never loads there are a bunch of other bugs
please include membership when viewing lists im on samsung android and i dont know if this applies with android users in general but this app version doesnt seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists its available on web browser though please consider including members of list option in the app
confusing i used the app to import important notes from another smartphone note book to my current phone although it transferred the information it is so hard to find it it disappeared completely
great internal comms system for our business

every company should use slack i dont usually give 5 stars but man slack is great for group company communication in the office at home and on the go takes a bit of getting used to but is well worth it

whatsapp tips make it as a medium not base for a friendship dont stop talking if your friend is not online find other ways to interactthis way even if whatsapp not available friend will exist
only two stars because frozen shadow is not compatible to my device  why oh why  make it compatible please
i think this game is such a load of rubbish it tries to con you into buying stuff from the instore app and cause you dont buy anything then you can be stuck on one part of the game for ages worsed app ive ever come across
great app but i heard that apple added some amazing emojis but ive been complaining about not seeing some emojis my iphone friend users send and it bothers me so can you just add those new emojis please thank you
nice app i suggest you to add a wordcount feature and font size i think its essential feature for a note app but well keep the good things up youve done a really amazing job thanks  
doesnt log in checked my credentials multiple times will not authenticate
 hanging so much even i am using higher end mobile having 3gb ram itself pls take the needfull action and fix that error
latest update should be clientside the most recent update added the following features which need to be changed to client side only colour nicknames and emoji all three change the appearance of the chat stream and are community controlled these are issues because they change everyones layout they need to be controlled by every individual of their own choosing
contacts name and pic i wanna know why alot of my new contacts just dont appear only appears if they are online or not and their pic and status dont  can this problem be solved
ugly design no autoimport from old install iphone ui design in the android app come on one day it suddenly wouldnt start  just showed globe and quit nothing similar has happened with alternative apps on top of that when i reinstalled it ignored the user folder so even though pics and supposedly chat is in there wechat did not read the folder so its all empty in chats inside wechat after a reinstall awful
awesome browser really easy to use and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension to get rid off annoying ads love it
bullshit update after updating its totally headachent able to download instead of mobiles its more suitable as pcwhen we search anything its always searhing for websitespreviously it was asking sepearately for web n image searchapart from this dwnldng is tatal worst as compare to previous version
forced reload on uploading pic on replying comment last night i tried to reply a comment by uploading a photo from my phone when i press on the button to select photos the app automatically goes back to the main page on other occasions i could enter to my gallery to select my image but as soon as i selected an image and press done the program again forced reload and suddenly go back to the main page please fix this and i will change my rating thank you
use this with dropsync dropbox autosync dropsync works the way dropbox should have it doesnt have any noticeable battery drain and automatically uploads files faster than dropbox alone
inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible 1 it crashes constantly 2 scrolling is very jerky 3 on screen rotation the window doesnt resize 4 there is no word wrap when answering certain forums 5 downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone 6 pages are very slow to load both the preinstalled samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox pity
good this is a great game good challenges too something you can just easily wip out when you are bored keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment
looks great works well and supports ubuntu but needs removable storage support an application like this is only as good as the service behind it and this is where dropbox excels  it works flawlessly securely and even has a native client available for linuxbased operating systems ubuntu and steamos my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage such as micro sdxc memory cards for which a star is lost
best browser but keeps crashing ive no clue but my browser keeps on crashing for unknown reasoneven while browsing on simplest of websitesthis is after the previous update updating again hopefully it goes away
miui7 y is the photo n sights wont show up in moment although i refresh so many time ad fix the probs pls

this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out   shut down after receiving a wechat message notification after update my chat backgrounds were all gone blank  i cant find my stickers as well i have to uninstall the app  but dont know if my chat history will be here or not
it was epicthen a certain update happened the most recent update got rid of what a ton of people loved i think supercell has some work to do if they think i am gonna be buying any more gems
outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular this is the first app which can be useful for all people
firefox is getting better  slowly it crashes regularly it doesnt play video on youtube otherwise it is a promising fast browser i still miss the gesturesswipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks see ucbrowser hd
why is there so much space there is so much white space and everything is so spaced out also the notifications are always late
very useful but very useful and good performance improvements but i can not find a way to set myself online or away anymore after the update where did it go
no auto upload for photos what worked super on my s4 does not work on nexus 6p i have to open the app for photos to back up sad very sad
good its very good to use    but i found some fualts   while writing lengthy status the words which we enter at starting will not be visible so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written   so make status editing line step by step instead a single line
not able to see recently connected people hi i am not able to see the recently connected people in the notification tabfrom where i can see the people with whom i connected recently
update sucks it has become so slow now that no page opens even on 3g trying to make the user interface like chrome is a ridiculous idea as everyone is saying the facebook page doesnt open n it even logged out please roll back your stupid update
great hamro patro
love this app all in one nepalese app 
does exactly what it states thank you
viber about the voice messages and chatting viber is the best app in the market about the calling services  even messenger performs better the app isnt optimised for wifi usage about the newest version until 23122015 there is a new option introduced which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat well it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad  finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly
one issuebig files downloading very slow i cant download 15 mb files quickplease fix it on next update
nice app bad notifications i like the browser but having updated cant recommend anymore push notified about a competition no one wants that kind of alert
browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc app does not use user input options ignores them again still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozzs www page  shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore  also they keep editing my review 
why we have to use this google we think its a time to make some changes in your team who is planning and making this horrible aps is apple or microsoft paying you for that whats about dark theme for the beginning for this useless app and make ability for sending files pls make everything in one place we dont need dozen usless aps
privacy its nice how it works with the agenda of your smartphone but i think they might do something for contacts that didnt have the app and you want them block if they download the app  the same way they give you the option for send invitations they should have the option for block them
ugh i dont recommend this because when i tried getting into the game it says that its downloading but it really isnt and then it doesnt work and i cant play it i was so excited to play the game but it just doesnt work for me
old version was better this new version needs lots of work find web pages take much longer to load cant tell it not to remember passwords for all sites
your new update sucks its now impossible to loot 2m in 4 hours wtf are you kidding me supercell no more dead bases and spent 500k to find a semi dead base with 180k loot dafuq u

excellent excellent excellent dear sir hamro patro is almost perfect towards the perfection i would like to request you to make the calendar flexible to write on desired dates to use it as planner available in mobile phones is it possible by your expertise sir
very poor service now a days for the last one month viber service is detoriated day by daynow the application respond too slow even in 3g network in wifi the message is always displayed that no network available please check your internet connection what happend to developer team are they sleeping from google market viber has disappeared suddenly
fun works perfectly well ads arent as annoying as you think especially for a free game
good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app
1 major annoyance in the new update show who is online and define what online means  on hangouts on a google product  using g can you readd timestamps for each message please add a dark mode feature as well
for the build 130203698649  new colour scheme adds nothing to the expirience but its the automated smart language update with no option to select the prefered language thatll be the main reason why ill uninstall this app
decent but getting worse with each update was my undisputed goto app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now getting buggier with each update crashes frequently especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously unresponsive for a few heavy websites still hoping the devs at google fix this because im still a huge chrome fan and gonna continue using it
rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish its very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it doesnt do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers never will i use drop box again people out there check other clouds eg one drive gmail drive just other drives very dissapointed with dropbox
i have to call it one of the most addictive games ever but now im dropping my rating because it took all my bonus candy away with the last update fix that guys not ok
just a tool for them to throw ads at you they use this app to electronically monitor your messages looking for key words once it recognizes a grouping of words it will start to send adds to your news feed that are similar in subject to that of which your talking about in your conversations
love it you are able to see celebrity tweets and get info you didnt know i love it
everyone able to see  highest score i would like to given one idea i could not saw everyone higher score atleast 1 to 5 member  i want to see each and everyone highest score through on my mobile  if you create this option everyone will be try to achive the highest score i hope you will be create this option of temple run 2
the best mobile browser ever opera mini is still the best mobile browser in terms of data saving however the browser doesnt support gif animationimage it doesnt support themes night mode is not impressive saved pages should be accessed locally and transferable to other opera mini devicebrowser above all its a good browser with beautiful ui its my number one choice browser thumbs up guys

error and only error i think this is the worst app made which doesnt load and mobile gets hangand full screen adsand in pdf format many error in spellingold one was very much better than this
stop opening like a full app i used to be able to play music on youtube and answer messages now it stops the video each time i click on a chat head if i really wanted to close an app and go to another to answer a message i would use something else
cant  play at all every time i load game it freezes then goes back to my home screen even tho iv reinstalled it many times
funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise
unable to send message or update this new version does not allows sending messages nor does it updates the status it keeps suggesting to come back linkedin what happened your app was one of the best
some time creating problm network problm it seems err more reasons showing
still the best mini i like the new look and news front very fast and efficient though for overall best all around browsers id go with maxthon yandex and ucbut for minis opera mini gold though uc mini is coming along strongminuses needs an adblock
app doesnt work after latest upgrade the facebook app refuses to work on my mobile data 3g after the latest upgrade it says it cannot connect right now
too many ads far more adverts than any other game ive played i know its free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance
awesome cant be productive without evernote  i always find myself searching for new and old notes  great app
good but ui ease of use still declining ive used evernote for years and its power is still there in its ability to find notes but its ui is still in steady decline with a lack of ease of use needs cleaner cleaner separation of functionality nowadays im having to dbl click a found note to view instead of a single click showing the note content disappointing to see this once magnificent software reduced to the current level of ui confusion that  so many other programs exhibit as well
issues with address book contacts i have turned off the feature to update my android contacts based on linkedin information but it still keeps updating with unwanted title on my address book i have uninstalled the app n reinstalled it cleared the data for the app but made no difference i am using galaxy s6 and would really appreciate if anyone can solve this issue the best option seems to uninstall the app for good and use just the broswer
fully ads based even in data connection and loads pretty badly i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app why kantipur network required ads based activities in this app google advertisement must not be used while using data and what a load while using this app kmg app was better than this i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app while using from data first loading the advertisement and after that loading news what a bullshit coding fix this for 5 star
old is best old version  is better then this version
great game really dislike the ads i usually dont  write reviews but this time i am because its getting  ridiculous every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying i know the ads help with money but at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up and forces you to watch it
 when  i open it download but it stop when it reaches to the letter o and it wont move even if there is strong connectionplease fix it i really want to play
great app minus the spam best notetaking app honestly this app does everything you could possibly need it to keywords make searching for notes so easy  however please stop pushing me so hard into paying for premium plans i do not need nor do i want them obviously if im dismissing the ad every time i use the app i must not be interested stop spamming me edit why are you still spamming me please please stop no does not mean keep asking
 new ui looks good but still laggy and unstable and wtf with ads
notifications not working i dont get notify about anything new followers retweet likes non of that and yes ive enabled all the notifications in the settings but nothing happened 
good app and nice try dear developers great job done but i would suggest u to get an idea with  fleksy keyboard app also for then not only me you shall get 5 rating from all around the worldalso i would suggest you should make easy standard keys for hamro keyboard all the best and hope you will update new innovative idea for this app soonsince i have suggested this app most of my frenz in nepal and overseas and since this app is one of the best app of mine i want to see more 5 for this app since you r the creator
a avid fan of wapp thats what we call it  a recommendation if u guys can include a feature in which i can stay offline even when the internet connectivity is on right now if the internet is on i keep getting msgs even though i want to stay offline n receive no msgs please work on this rest u people rock 
nice apps
puro malware viva telegram nose como han hecho que con la nueva funcin de marshmallow de compartir que te salgan contactos directamente solo te salga whatsapp siempre uso telegram y han conseguido que nunca me salga esta funcin con telegram y solo con whatsapp desinstalando ya
govinda gautam apps is good having facillity of typing  both nepali and english fonts directly but i couldnt type the half nepali font
please do something its too slow need update please add a feature to go directly in the start of every chat like whatsapp we have to scroll for hours to go to top and when finally we are  there it just goes to the bottom  danm it i would give 5 stars if someone solve this one please i am expecting a response
regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about 40mb starting up  the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted i love uc but im sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs its probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however
text notifications do not work i loved hangouts however since a few months ago im not able to receive text messages notifications it is really annoying i receive voice calls and invites notifications ive looked everywhere for the solution and wasnt able to solve my problem im giving up im so frustrated
the new update sucks i hate that they switched favorite to like  i love twitter so much but its turning into facebook real fast i previously rated it 5 stars but right now im rating it 1 star due to te next update ill rate it 5 again once the change is made until then if you want a second facebook experience feel free to download
cant call i cant  make out going calls to anyone on facebook  when the person im calling answers the call it says contacting then after a few mins an operator says that the person in calling cant be reach and that i have to leave a message after the beep
cant hook up credit card to wallet unable to connect american express credit card to wallet get the message system is busy please try again later     also why cant we post just at text post to our moments
voice messages problem most times recorded message dont be delivered completely it is always missing a big part of it i noticed that this happens when ever the cellular network is unstable how ever it is a big disadvantage of the app hope you fix it so so i can give the app 5
what has happened it doesnt give me my messages on time and people can not hear me on outcalls at all please fix other wise i would give it 5 stars
ads problem
its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them
lucky money i have some money sent to me and i want to give to my chinese friends as token of luck but dont see lucky money or wallet anywhere i have english wechat
popup and search using image i seriously hate that opera mini does not support popups i need popups enabled from where do i choose to enable it i am forced to use uc browser due to this  and please provide an option in the long press menu to search using any image please guys  we are waiting  reply atleast 
google chrome app it allows me to browse the internet on a phone of all things seriously guys were living in the future 5 stars because it always works
temple run pretty good the game is funbut i would like it if it didnt have so many videos for one specific app most of the time it would also be nice if you could choose to be a boy or a girl character overall the game is okaypretty good
please add this option i love using hangouts for both im and sms but when sending a photo from the share menu the app defaults to my sms plan thus costing me money if i try to go back the hangouts app quits leaving me with no way to choose of i want to send a picture via mmssms or hangouts im its costing me a small fortune the option to choose how which messaging service you want to use when sharing a photo would be great
best app i cant believe that it is free they treat it as if you paid for it
its getting hang once i will be chatting with someone seriously and it gets hang suddenly and i wont be able to type nor open my wechat and after few mints it saying wechat is not responding properly and have to stop it pls take a look at it 
not the same with my hand on my heart i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success unfortunately this hame has suffered the same fate it is no longer the brilliant game it once was its  an updated version with none of the original stuff that once made it great
good game but i have always liked temple run however the new update which included a new map has ruined it for me a little bit  i would of rather of it been snowy on the default map since since for me anyway the new map is a bit confusing and can be harder
fun diversion good game to take a quick break from whatever youre doing nice test of your ability to see and hear whats coming ahead and react the latest update with the winter map improves the core game quite a bit
good as far as i have it fast and reliable for now only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faast but thats mayth be due some option in phone maybee
ehhh at first i gave whatsapp 5 stars i am now decreasing them to three there are multiple reasons for this 1 let me send videos no matter how long they are 2 create a feature where i can make custom vibrations for different contacts 3 being completely invisible when i block someone 4 wake screen when i get a message notification 5 if i choose to mark a message as unread it should reflect to the sender that the message is unread 6 make video chat available 7 update emojis
great way to stay organized i jot notes for work family shopping lists music  things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to great place to store everything
its great when it works but right now it wont download any mms it just says theyre there and wont download them and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead
ads ads and more ads i dont mind having ads but when its a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me i deleted this i dont remember that many ads last time i played this if you can handle ads all the time its a fun game to play but no longer for me
browser issue hi team when ever i press the back buttonoption automatically its closing the browser with a message please fix this issue
not good this app before was no 1  nepali app in android but when they update the app it is now really wastefulafter using the app there is no exit  button please fix it still  not yet  done the improvements whats wrong with the app problem in my  samsung galaxy s3  only 
good but not great app is awesome saves me a ton of memory but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better 1 you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album 2 once pictures are in album the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album if you could do those 2 things it would be 
slow with weird lack of features really slow not sure why has good search bar but no way to add search engines cannot download images from google search no problem  downloading from bing it seems there are good feature spread between this and opera mobile combined they would make a good browser but independently theyre not good enough
great app the latest update to slack has enabled an in app experience for gifs and while it isnt the smoothest implementation it is definitely a step in the right direction really enjoy using the app and their responsiveness to user comments makes this a great experience
